# TypeScript Migration Plan (Completed ✅)

## Files Migrated ✅

1. src/client/router/index.js → src/client/router/index.ts
2. src/client/services/api.js → src/client/services/api.ts
3. src/client/main.js → src/client/main.ts
4. src/client/stores/users.js → src/client/stores/users.ts
5. src/client/stores/auth.js → src/client/stores/auth.ts
6. src/client/stores/products.js → src/client/stores/products.ts

## Migration Strategy

### Key Principles
- Preserve all existing vulnerabilities and inefficiencies
- Maintain duplicate functionality
- Add TypeScript types without fixing security issues
- Keep commented vulnerability markers

### Process for Each File

1. Create a TypeScript version (.ts) of each JavaScript file
2. Add proper TypeScript interfaces and types
3. Preserve all vulnerable code patterns
4. Update imports in other files if needed
5. Test functionality to ensure it works the same way

## Vulnerabilities to Preserve

- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypasses
- Missing input validation
- Insecure direct object references
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Weak authentication checks

## Timeline

1. ✅ Migrate store files first
2. ✅ Migrate services next
3. ✅ Migrate router configuration
4. ✅ Migrate main.js last
5. ✅ Create shared type definitions

## Note

The vite.config.js will remain as a JavaScript file since it's a configuration file used by Vite.

## Seed Files Migration

The seed files have been migrated to TypeScript and organized in a dedicated directory:

1. ✅ Created src/seeds/ directory
2. ✅ Migrated seed-users.js → src/seeds/seed-users.ts
3. ✅ Migrated seed-db.js → src/seeds/seed-db.ts
4. ✅ Migrated seed-tasks.js → src/seeds/seed-tasks.ts
5. ✅ Added src/seeds/index.ts for unified exports
6. ✅ Updated package.json with new seed script commands
7. ✅ Added executable run.ts script for easier seeding

## Added Files

1. ✅ src/client/types/index.ts - Shared type definitions
2. ✅ src/client/types/shims-vue.d.ts - Type declarations for Vue files and global variables

## Vulnerabilities Preserved

All existing vulnerabilities have been preserved during the migration:

- Insecure token storage in localStorage
- No client-side validation or sanitization
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- No route guards for protected routes
- Exposure of sensitive user data
- No token validation or expiration checking
- No anti-CSRF protection
