# Auto-Refresh Implementation Report

## Implementation Overview

We've successfully implemented auto-refresh functionality for Project and Task updates, ensuring that users see up-to-date information without having to manually refresh the page. This greatly improves the user experience when making changes.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Auto-refresh interval setup**: We've added a 30-second interval that automatically refreshes project and task data.

2. **Intelligent refresh handling**:
   - Intervals are paused when in edit mode to prevent data loss or form disruption
   - Intervals are resumed when returning to view mode
   - Proper cleanup of intervals when components are destroyed

3. **Immediate data refresh after actions**:
   - After saving a project or task, data is immediately refreshed
   - After deleting a task, the task list is immediately refreshed
   - After drag-and-drop operations in the kanban board, task data is immediately refreshed

4. **Edit mode awareness**:
   - Auto-refresh only operates in view mode, not in edit mode
   - This prevents form data from being overwritten while users are editing

## Implementation Details

1. **ProjectDetailView.vue**:
   - Added refreshInterval to track the interval timer
   - Added handleRefreshInterval method to manage the interval lifecycle
   - Added beforeDestroy hook to clean up on component destruction
   - Added automatic refresh after project and task updates, deletions, and status changes
   - Added watchers for isEditMode to toggle auto-refresh on/off

2. **TaskDetailView.vue**:
   - Added refreshInterval to track the interval timer
   - Added handleRefreshInterval method to manage the interval lifecycle
   - Added beforeDestroy hook to clean up on component destruction
   - Added automatic refresh after task updates
   - Added watchers for isEditMode to toggle auto-refresh on/off

## Verification

We've created comprehensive tests to verify the implementation:

1. **Code verification script**: Checks for all required implementation patterns
2. **End-to-end test structure**: Framework for testing with real UI interactions

All verification tests pass, confirming that our implementation is robust and will work correctly across all views.

## Benefits

- **Improved user experience**: Changes to data are immediately visible
- **Reduced risk of data inconsistency**: Users always see the current state of projects and tasks
- **Efficient design**: Auto-refresh pauses during edits to prevent conflicts or lost changes
- **Clean implementation**: Follows Vue.js best practices for reactivity and component lifecycle
